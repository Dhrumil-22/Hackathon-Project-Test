# NSFW Content Moderation System 🚫🖼️💬

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **content moderation system** designed to automatically detect and filter **NSFW (Not Safe For Work)** text and images.  
It helps platforms maintain a safe environment by preventing inappropriate content from being uploaded or displayed.  

Built for **hackathons**, the system is lightweight, extendable, and easy to integrate with any web or mobile application.

## ⚡ Features
- 📝 **Text Moderation** – Detects offensive, abusive, or adult content in text.
- 🖼️ **Image Moderation** – Identifies NSFW or explicit content in uploaded images.
- ⚙️ **REST API** – Exposes moderation endpoints for integration with frontends.
- 🎨 **Frontend Integration** – Demo frontend with Axios for text/image checks.
- 📊 **Scalable** – Can be extended with advanced ML models or external APIs.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (with Axios for API calls)  
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)  
- **Machine Learning / Models:**  
  - Pre-trained NSFW detection models (e.g., `nsfw_model` for images)  
  - Text classification filters (for bad/offensive words detection)  
- **Database (Optional):** SQLite / MongoDB (for logs & analytics)  
- **Deployment:** Docker / Localhost (for hackathon demo)

👉 This README is **plug-and-play**. You’ll just need to:  
- Change **repo link**  
- Update **hackathon name & team members**  
- Add any **specific models/APIs** you’re using  

Would you like me to also prepare a **short version** of this README (1-page style), so you can paste it directly in your hackathon submission form without the long details?

- Duration: 24/48 hrs
- Project Type: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
